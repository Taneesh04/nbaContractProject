# ![Woodbridge (Custom)](https://cdn.nba.com/teams/legacy/www.nba.com/timberwolves/sites/timberwolves/files/towns-signing.jpg) NBA Contacts Analysis

My name is Taneesh Amin, and I am a Freshman Student who is planning on majoring in Computer Science and/or Data Science with minors with Business Administration and Sport Management. 

As an avid character in politics, I enjoy analyzing political data to see how the political landscape of my local town is doing

Using data from Middlesex County, I was able to get a full data analysis of Woodbridge Township and it's different wards. I made an analysis to recognize the fact that voter turnout had a significant effect on how democratic a down was. Additionally, I learned that South Asians tend to be a lot more democratic than non South Asian Towns.
